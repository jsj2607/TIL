# Relfection: 01_pjt movie data

## 1. Liked

    I liked working with json data. As a psychology major, I did not have a lot of chance to work with data that has this kind of structure. I usually worked with data that has clean spreadsheet type structure. I feel like I can analyze and make use of more variety of data.

## 2. Learned

    I learned how to reorganize data for my objective. Data is often stored and structured in a way that does not perfectly fit to my goal. 

    I learned how information can be stored for movie review website. I can imagine how websites with similar purpose structure and store data for their need.

    I learned how to open multiple files in python and extract information I need and store it for my need. 

## 3. Lacked

    Opening different files python didn't come across my mind easily. I also did not know how .keys() store data. I thought I can use list methods, but I couldn't. I think I have to keep practice how to search the right programming information I need. I searched for how to open files in python, but the results were not super useful. I think with my increased Python literacy and more searching, I can better search and understand the searched information.

## 4. Longed for

    I want to handle different types of data and different data structure. The data I used today was not too complex. It had maximum of 3 nested layers, and the task I did could be completed by basic python syntax (for loop, f string, opening json). I believe there was a more simpler, or memory saving way to complete the task.
